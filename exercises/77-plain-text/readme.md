The Power of Plain Text
=======================

Challenge
---------

Design a small address book database (name, phone number, and so on) using a
straightforward binary representation in your language of choice. Do this
before reading the rest of this challenge.

    1. Translate the format into a plain text format using ~~XML~~ JSON.

    2. For each version, add a new, variable-length field called _directions_
       inn which you might enter directions to each person's house.
